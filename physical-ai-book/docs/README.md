# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook - Modules Structure

This textbook is organized into modules that build upon each other to provide a comprehensive learning path in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
This module covers the fundamentals of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the communication backbone for robotic applications. Students will learn about nodes, topics, services, and actions that enable coordinated robot behavior.

### Weeks 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI
- Foundations of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- From digital AI to robots that understand physical laws
- Overview of humanoid robotics landscape
- Sensor systems: LiDAR, cameras, IMUs, force/torque sensors

### Weeks 3-5: ROS 2 Fundamentals
- ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
- Nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Building ROS 2 packages with Python
- Launch files and parameter management

## Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
This module introduces simulation environments where students can safely test and validate their robotic algorithms before deployment on physical systems.

### Weeks 6-7: Robot Simulation with Gazebo
- Gazebo simulation environment setup
- URDF and SDF robot description formats
- Physics simulation and sensor simulation
- Introduction to Unity for robot visualization

## How to Navigate
Each week includes learning objectives, detailed explanations, practical examples, exercises, and knowledge checks to reinforce your understanding of the concepts.
