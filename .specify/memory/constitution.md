# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Documentation-First
All content must be well-documented with clear examples; Every concept explained should have practical applications and code samples where relevant

### Academic Rigor
All technical claims must be supported by citations, with at least 40% from peer-reviewed or academic sources

### Modular Organization
Content organized in clear modules and sections; Each module builds on previous knowledge systematically

### Accessibility & Clarity
Content written for CS/AI students with basic programming knowledge; Concepts explained in clear, accessible language

### Technology-Neutral Presentation
Technical concepts explained independent of specific tools when possible; When specific tools are discussed, alternatives should be noted

### Responsive Design
Documentation site must be responsive and accessible across devices; Follows best practices for web accessibility standards

## Development Standards
Technology stack: Docusaurus, React, JavaScript/TypeScript; Prerequisites: Ubuntu OS, ROS 2 Humble or newer, Node.js 18+; All content must be citable and well-researched

## Review and Quality Process
All content reviewed for technical accuracy; Modules tested for student comprehension; Documentation updates synchronized with code changes

## Governance
Constitution governs all project practices; Amendments require team consensus and documented approval; Regular reviews scheduled to ensure content remains current and accurate
