# Tasks: Sidebar Structure for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Input**: Sidebar format requirements from user input
**Feature**: Create a clean, uniform sidebar matching the specified structure

**Tests**: No explicit testing requirements for sidebar structure, so tests are not included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by implementation phases to enable systematic development.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Docusaurus project**: `docs/`, `static/`, `src/`, `blog/` at repository root
- **Configuration files**: `docusaurus.config.js`, `sidebars.js` at repository root
- Paths adjusted based on plan.md structure for Docusaurus textbook

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: These are the actual tasks generated based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Research findings from research.md
  - Sidebar structure requirements from user input

  Tasks are organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment
  ============================================================================
-->

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Prepare project infrastructure for sidebar implementation

- [ ] T001 Verify Docusaurus project structure exists in physical-ai-book directory
- [ ] T002 Confirm sidebars.js file exists at repository root with current structure

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5 → P6)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May use concepts from US1
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May use concepts from US1-US2
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May use concepts from US1-US3
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates concepts from US1-US4
- **User Story 6 (P6)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on content from US1-US5

### Within Each User Story

- Core content implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- All tasks within each user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members (though sequential order is recommended for consistency)

### Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all Module 1 structure tasks together:
Task: "Create/update _category_.json in docs/week-1-2/ with title \"Module 1: Introduction to Physical AI\""
Task: "Add Humanoid Robotics Overview content file to docs/week-1-2/humanoid-robotics-overview.md"
Task: "Add Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence content file to docs/week-1-2/physical-ai-embodied-intelligence.md"
Task: "Add Sensors in Physical AI Systems content file to docs/week-1-2/sensors-physical-ai-systems.md"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Module 1 structure
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test Module 1 structure independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Module 1) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 (Module 2) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 (Module 3) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 (Module 4) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 (Capstone) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7. Add User Story 6 (Sidebar Config) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
8. Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns → Final deploy (Complete Textbook!)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Stories 1 (Module 1)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Module 2) 
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Module 3)
3. After US1-3 are complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 4 (Module 4)
   - Developer B: User Story 5 (Capstone)
   - Developer C: User Story 6 (Sidebar Configuration)
4. All developers: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
